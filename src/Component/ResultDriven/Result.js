            Any income or earnings statements are estimates of income potential
            only, and there is no assurance that your earnings will match the
            figures we present. Your reliance on the figures we present is at
            your own risk. Any income or earnings depicted are NOT to be
            interpreted as common, typical, expected, or normal for the average
            student. This particular result may be exceptional, and the
            variables that impact results are so numerous and sometimes
            uncontrollable, that Real Advisors makes no guarantees as to your
            income or earnings of any kind, at any time.
            <br />
            Where specific income figures are used, and attributed to an
            individual or business, those persons or businesses have earned that
            amount. But, there is no assurance that your earnings or income will
            match those figures, or that you will make any money at all. If you
            rely upon our examples or figures, you do so at your own risk, and
            you accept all risk associated with your reliance.
            <br />
            Any and all claims or representations as to income earnings made on
            our web sites or in our materials or information are not to be
            considered as average earnings. Testimonials are not representative.
            There can be no assurance that any prior successes, or past results,
            as to income earnings, can be used as an indication of your future
            success or results. Monetary and income results are based on many
            factors. We have no way of knowing how well you will do, as we do
            not know you, your background, your work ethic, or your business

            will win any incentives or prizes that may be offered, that you will
            make any income or earnings, that you will do well, or that you will
            make any money at all. If you rely upon our examples or figures, you
            do so at your own risk, and you accept all risk associated with your
            reliance. Real property businesses and earnings derived therefrom,
